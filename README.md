# SvelteKit Apollo GraphQL Example with create-svelte

[Demo link](https://sveltekit-apollo-graphql-typescript.netlify.app)

[Javascript version](https://github.com/tmrp/sveltekit-apollo-graphql)

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Developing

create a `.env` file in the project root directory and copy over the contents of `.env.example`

Install dependencies with Yarn of NPM:

```bash
yarn

# or

npm install
```

Start development server with:

```bash
yarn dev

# or

npm run dev
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build

# or

npm run build

```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
